We'll always open the file, do some operations and close the file

It's a very good practice to close the file once after completing our operations
Sometimes we'll forget to close the file right?

To handle that situation we're using with statement
* It'll open the file
* Performs the operations
* Closes the file automatically once the operations completed
	
Advantages of with statement:
-----------------------------

1. We're not required to close file explicitly as it'll be closed automatically.
2. We can group file related operations within the block so that readability will be imporoved


tell() and seek() method:
-------------------------

we can use tell() method to know current cursor position(file pointer)

seek() -> Move the cursor to the required position

file.seek(n) -> Here 'n' numbers will be moved from beginning of the file.
