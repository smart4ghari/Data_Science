Constructors:
-------------

* The constructor is a special method
* The name of the constructor is always __init__
* We're not required to call the constructor explicitly, it'll be executed automatically whenever 
we're creating an object

How Many times constructor will be executed?
--------------------------------------------

Per object constructor will be executed only once.

Purpose of using Constructor:
-----------------------------
Both declaration and initialization is going to be performed inside constructor.
So the main purpose of constructor is to declare and initialize "instance variable".

__init__ means initialization.

Within python class constructor is always optional.
If we're not providing any constructor means then python will provide default constructor.
Default constructor will be provided internally by PVM.

Is it possible to call constructor explicitly?
----------------------------------------------
Yes, we can call the constructor explicitly. Then it'll be executed just like a normal method and
new object won't be created.

If we're defining multiple constructor PVM only consider last constructor.

Difference between constructor and method:
------------------------------------------

         Methods  												Constructor
	
1. Method name can be anything					1. Constructor name should be __init__()
2. Methods wont' be executed automatically,     2. Constructors are executed automatically
   we need to call explicitly
3. Per object we can call methods any number 	3. Per object we can call constructor only once
   of times										
4. Inside method, we can write business logic   4. Inside constructor we've to write code to
   based on our requirement						   declare and initialize instance variable.
