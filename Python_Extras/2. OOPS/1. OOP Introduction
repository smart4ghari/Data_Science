OOP - Object Oriented Programming

POP - Procedure Oriented Programming

In POP total activities is divided into multiple functions and we can call that function 
based on our requirement

OOP -> Real-time entities called objects

Python contains both POP and OOP


Questions:
----------
What is Class?
What is Object?
What is Reference?

Class:
------
Take an example of building a house.

First we need a plan to build a house.

Imagine that the house is being built on Madurai city.

I need the same house in chennai as well, so the plan will be same right.

Only city differs.

Here the plan or blueprint is known as "Class".

Objects:
--------
Based on plan we're building a house which is known as "Object".

The physical existence of a class is known as "Object".


*-------------------------------------------------*
Class : It's a blue print for objects.			  *
Objects : Physical existence of class is object.  *
*-------------------------------------------------*

One class contains many objects.

Every class can contain -> Variables and Methods

Variables -> properties
Methods -> Actions


3 types of variable:
-------------------

1. Instance variable (Object level variable)
2. Static variable (Class level variable)
3. Local variable (Method level variable)


3 types of Method:
------------------

1. Static method
2. Instance method
3. Class method


Reference Variables
-------------------

Tv Object -> We need remote to operate

Reference variable can be used to refer objects.
By using reference variable, we can invoke functionality of object.

For a single object, there may be a chance of multiple references.

Creating object in python:
---------------------------

reference variable = classname()

Whenever we're creating an object automatically constructor variable will be executed

Here constructor is nothing but __init__() method.
